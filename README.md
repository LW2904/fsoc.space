This is the `workbench` branch of the repository where all the work happens. The [`master`](https://github.com/LW2904/fsoc.space/tree/master) branch is hosted through GitHub Pages on [fsoc.space](https://fsoc.space).

- `static/` contains files that are directly copied to the `master` branch
- `words/` is used to build the folder of the same name on the `master` branch, using [`words`](https://github.com/LW2904/words) (this is where all blog posts live)
