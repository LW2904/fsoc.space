                There used to be a bunch of posts here, but I am unhappy with their 
                contents and formatting. I don't want to force someone to sift through 
                low-quality articles until they find a good one, so I will endeavour not 
                to add to the pile.
            </p>

            <p>
                I'm looking forward to when I'll have enough time to touch up some old posts 
                (or even to write some new ones) and to put them up here.
            </p>
        </div>
    </>);
