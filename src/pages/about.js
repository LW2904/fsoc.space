        <p>
            I'm a software developer living in Austria.
        </p>

        <p>
            My area of (relative) expertise is mostly in JavaScript, usually in the context of 
            front end and back end development. I've been writing stuff with NodeJS and React for 
            years and know my way around the ecosystem and many best practices.
        </p>

        <p>
            When appropriate, I also really like developing applications (and libraries) using "system 
            programming languages" like C++, C and <a href={'https://dlang.org/'}>D</a>.
        </p>

        <p>
            I have an eye (and appreciation) for detail and I'd like to think that this is also 
            recognisable in the projects I work on.
        </p>

        <p>
            If you're curious about specific things I'm doing or have done please feel free to take a 
            look at my <a href={'/projects'}>projects</a> or to read through some of 
            my <a href={'/words'}>writings</a> (which are usually about those same projects).
        </p>
